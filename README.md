  ## Installation
  Fork this repo into your GitHub. Make sure the fork process has been completed without any issue by checking all files in your forked repo. Verify wheter you have node.js installed on your desktop or not by running the comman node -v in your terminal. If you do not have node.js installed, please go to https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs and it will walk you through the process.

  ## Usage
  Once you completed the installation process, now it's time for you to generate your team profile and display in HTML. Once you try to run node index.js, it will probably give you an error BECAUSE the required dependencies are not installed yet into the root directory. Run npm install to install required dependancies. Then, you should be able to run node index.js. You will be prompted with questions and provide employees information. Feel free to add as many as you want or stop adding when you are done. Screenshot of prompt is shown below:
